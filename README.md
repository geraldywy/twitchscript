# twitchscript

Creates a facebook bot, verified by a temporary email, links it to twitch to be verified on twitch as well.
Stores bot information into a text file to be reused.

bot.py acts as the main class, follow.py to specifically follow/chat, gen.py to specifically generate bots.
Use appy.py to do what is shown below.

Note: As twitch and facebook's web layout has changed from the time i wrote this script, the scripts might require some updating to the xpaths for selenium to locate the proper fields.
